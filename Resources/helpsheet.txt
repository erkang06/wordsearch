-----------> WELCOME TO MY OBJECTIVELY BAD WORDSEARCH <-----------
If you have come here, I can safely assume that you have been able to choose how many numbers you'd like in your wordsearch. To use the wordsearch, you click on a letter and drag to the end of a word before releasing. If you letters you dragged make an actual word, the letters of that word will change colour and become unselected in the case of multiple words sharing a letter like in an actual wordsearch lmao. To generate a new wordsearch, click that 'Generate Wordsearch' button in the tooltip. The rest should be straightforward.
