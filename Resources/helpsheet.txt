-------------> WELCOME TO MY OBJECTIVELY BAD WORDSEARCH <-------------
If you have come here, I can safely assume that you have been able to choose how many numbers you'd like in your wordsearch. To use the wordsearch, you click on each letter cuz they're all buttons lmao. If you click all the letters of a word and no other letters, the letters of that word will change colour and become unselected in the case of multiple words sharing a letter like in an actual wordsearch lmao. To generate a new wordsearch, click that 'Generate Wordsearch' button in the tooltip. The rest should be straightforward.
